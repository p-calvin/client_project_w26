            <h2>Interviews</h2>

            <h3>Interview Prep</h3>

            <p>
                Preparing for interviews is a good way to gain confidence and can set you apart from other candidates.
                Key tips include:
            </p>
        
            <ul>
                    <li>Review common interview questions for your field. This can include both behavioral and technical questions. For technical practice,
                        consider using tools like <a href="https://www.w3schools.com" target="_blank">W3Schools</a> or <a href="https://leetcode.com/" target="_blank">Leetcode</a>to practice.
                    </li>
                    <li>Understand your company's mission, products, culture, and value.</li>
                    <li>Utilize the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to organize your thoughts and experiences and share their impact.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Mock Interviews</h3>

                <p>Mock interviews can be a great way to prepare for your internship or job experiences. 
                    Practicing with a friend, colleague, or family member can lower interview anxiety and 
                    set you up for success. Mock interviews can also give you constructive feedback on 
                    your communication and body language. To prepare for your interviews, consider utilizing
                    some CDO resources:
