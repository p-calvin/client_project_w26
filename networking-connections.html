            <h2>Why Networking and Connections Matter</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Networking isn’t about collecting contacts — it’s about building relationships.</strong>

                The UMSI Career Development Office helps students develop authentic, strategic connections with peers, 
                alumni, faculty, and employers. Whether you’re just starting to explore career 
                paths or actively searching for internships and jobs, networking can help you 
                gain insight, confidence, and opportunities you won’t find through job postings alone.

                This page introduces core networking strategies, explains how to prepare for 
                career fairs and events, and highlights ways to build meaningful connections 
                within the UMSI community and beyond.
            </p>

            <p>Networking helps you:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Learn what different roles and industries are really like.</li>
                    <li>Discover opportunities before they are publicly posted.</li>
                    <li>Practice talking about your interests, skills, and goals.</li>
                    <li>Build relationships that can support you throughout your career.</li>
                </ul>
               
            <p>
                You don't need to be "good at networking" to get started — networking is a skill
                you can learn and practice over time.

        <h2>Career Fairs</h2>

            <p>
                Career fairs are one of the most direct ways to connect with employers who are 
                actively interested in UMSI students. These events give you the chance to learn 
                about organizations, ask questions, and make a strong first impression, even if 
                you’re not ready to apply yet.
                Career fairs can feel overwhelming, but with preparation and a clear goal, 
                they can be a valuable part of your career development process.
            </p>

            <h3>Preparing for Career Fairs</h3>

            <p> Before attending a career fair, take time to prepare.</p>

            <p>
                <strong>Before the event:</strong>
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Review the list of attending employers and identify a few you want to prioritize.</li>
                <li>Research each organization's mission, roles, and hiring timelines.</li>
                <li>Prepare a brief introduction, or "elevator pitch" about who you are and what you're 
                    interested in. Download our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1633aBaWXIZW_ImTP-jKKN0QNXK9-RpXXmVznRgA4ZHQ/edit?tab=t.0" target="_blank">elevator pitch rubric sheet</a>
                    to get started on building your elevator pitch.
                </li>
                <li>Bring updated copies of your resume and dress in attire that aligns with the dress code of the event and companies you're interested in.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <strong>During the event:</strong>
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Keep yourself hydrated to help with career-fair anxiety.</li>
                <li>Ask thoughtful questions that show genuine interest.</li>
                <li>Take notes after conversations to help you remember details.</li>
                <li>Stay curious and be open to new possibilities. Even short conversations
                    can be meaningful.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <strong>After the event:</strong>
            </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Follow up with recruiters or contacts you met during the event.</li>
                    <li>Research opportunities and companies you learned about.</li>
                    <li>Reflect on what you discovered and how it shapes your next steps.</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Networking Outreach & Follow-up</h3>

            <p>
                Reaching out to professionals, including alumni, is a key networking skill. A 
                short, thoughtful outreach message can open the door to conversations and learning
                opportunities, particularly after career fair connections arise.
            </p>

            <h2>Faculty Connections</h2>

            <p> UMSI faculty are an important part of your professional network. Many faculty members have
                industry experience, research connections, and insight into career paths in Information Science.

                Ways to build connections include: </p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Attending office hours.</li>
                    <li>Asking questions about career paths related to course topics.</li>
                    <li>Participating in research, projects, or independent studies.</li>
                    <li>Staying in touch after a course ends.</li>
                </ul>

            <p>
                Faculty connections can lead to mentorship, references, and opportunities for deeper learning.
            </p>

            <h2>Peer Connections</h2>

            <p>Your classmates are also part of your professional network. Peers can: </p>

            
                <ul>
                    <li>Share internship and job search experiences.</li>
                    <li>Recommend resources and opportunities.</li>
                    <li>Offer feedback on resumes, portfolios, and interview prep.</li>
                    <li>Become future collaborators and colleagues.</li>
                </ul>

            <p>
                Build peer connections by participating in class discussions, group projects,
                student organizations, and career events. Networking with peers now helps create
                a strong professional community that grows over time.

            <h2>Informational Interviews</h2>
            
            <p>
                Informational interviews are short, low-pressure conversations where you learn from someone's 
                career experience. They are not job interviews, but opportunities to ask questions explore paths, and 
                build relationships.

                The CDO recommends using the <strong>TIARA</strong> method to structure your questions:

            </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Trends</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Insights</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Advice</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Resources</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Assignments</strong></li>
                </ul>
    

            <h2>Getting Started with Networking</h2>
            
            <p>
                If networking feels intimidating, start small:
            </p>

            
                <ul>
                    <li>Attend one career event.</li>
                    <li>Reach out to one alum or peer.</li>
                    <li>Schedule a career coaching appointment.</li>
                    <li>Practice your introduction with someone you trust.</li>
                </ul>

            <p>
                You don't need to do everything at once. Networking is a long-term process,
                and every connection helps you move forward.
