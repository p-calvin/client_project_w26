      <h2>Your Resume</h2>

      <img src="images/resume-1.jpg" alt="	Students work together in a bright classroom with screens and projectors.">

      <p>
        Your resume is more than a list of experiences: it is a tool for telling your professional 
        story. A strong resume clearly communicates what you've accomplished, what you're good at,
        and how your skills align with the roles you're pursuing.
      </p>

      <p>
        The UMSI Career Development Office supports students at every stage of 
        resume development, from first drafts to target application materials for internships,
        jobs, and fellowships. The guidance on this page reflects what career coaches share
        in one-on-one appointments and workshops, so you can build confidence in your materials
        no matter where you're starting.

      <h2>Craft a Resume that Tells Your Story</h2>
        <p>
          A compelling resume focuses on impact, skills, and relevance, not just responsibilities.
          Employers want to understand how your experiences prepare you for their role
          and what value you bring to their team.
        </p>

        <p>
          UMSI students bring a wide range of experiences to the table, including coursework,
          research, projects, internships, part-time work, and student organizations. All of these
          can be resume-worthy when framed thoughtfully and clearly.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you're unsure how to translate your experiences into strong resume content, a CDO Career Coach
          can help you identify strengths, refine language, and tailor your resume to your goals.

      <h2>Resume Writing Made Easy: Steps to Success</h2>

      <p>
        Writing a resume doesn't have to feel overwhelming. Breaking the process into steps can help you move forward
        with more clarity and intention.
      </p>

      
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Start with a Strong Foundation: </strong>Use a UMSI-approved template to ensure your formatting is clean, readable, and professional.</li>
        <li><strong>Select Relevant Experiences: </strong>Focus on roles, projects, and activities that connect to the skills required for your target roles.</li>
        <li><strong>Write Impact-Focused Bullet Points: </strong>Describe what you did, how you did it, and why it mattered. Highlight tools, methods, and outcomes whenever possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Tailor for Each Opportunity: </strong>Adjust language, keywords, and emphasis to align with each job or internship description.</li>
        <li><strong>Review and Edit:</strong> Proofread for errors, check formatting, and ask for feedback from peers or a career coach.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>What Employers Look for in a Resume</h2>

      <p>While every industry and role is different, employers consistently look for resumes that are:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Easy to scan and well-organized.</li>
          <li>Clear about skills, tools, and methods used.</li>
          <li><strong>Focused on outcomes and impact.</strong></li>
          <li>Relevant to the position being applied for.</li>
        </ul>

      <p>
        Your resume doesn't need to include everything you've ever done. Instead, it should highlight
        what matters most for your next step.

      <h2>Tailoring Your Resume for Different Roles</h2>

      <p>
        One resume rarely fits every opportunity. Tailoring your resume helps you show 
        employers that you understand their role and how your background connects to their needs.

        When tailoring your resume: </p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Utilize language from the job description.</li>
          <li>Prioritize the most relevant skills and experiences.</li>
          <li>Adjust bullet points to emphasize applicable tools or outcomes.</li>
        </ul>

      <p>
        Tailoring doesn't mean rewriting everything. Instead, small and strategic changes
        can make a big difference.
